  Abstract                 = {This paper analyzes the underlying architecture of a serial Bloom filter string searching algorithm to identify the performance impact of this algorithm for large datasets. Then, a parallel multi-core driven Bloom filter algorithm using software application threads is studied as benchmark. Experimental results suggest that for a set of 10 million strings, this algorithm exhibits speedups of up to 3.3× against a serial Bloom filter algorithm, when using an 8-logical processor multi-core architecture. To further improve the speedup, a many-core driven parallel Bloom filter algorithm is proposed using the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) parallel computing platform. The proposed algorithm segments the string list into blocks of words and threads in generating the bit table for the string searching process, which maximizes computational performance and sustains consistent string searching results. Experimental results suggest that the proposed algorithm extends the speedup to 5.5× against a serial Bloom filter algorithm, when using a 256-core CUDA graphics processing unit architecture.},

  Abstract                 = {Frequent pattern mining on data streams is of interest recently. However, it is not easy for users to determine a proper frequency threshold. It is more reasonable to ask users to set a bound on the result size. We study the problem of mining top K frequent itemsets in data streams. We introduce a method based on the Chernoff bound with a guarantee of the output quality and also a bound on the memory usage. We also propose an algorithm based on the Lossy Counting Algorithm. In most of the experiments of the two proposed algorithms, we obtain perfect solutions and the memory space occupied by our algorithms is very small. Besides, we also propose the adapted approach of these two algorithms in order to handle the case when we are interested in mining the data in a sliding window. The experiments show that the results are accurate.},
