# Outcome
I recieved my honours degree from the University of the Witwatersrand with distinction. 

# Missing data
I have removed the font and `images/` folder from the repo since these images are of the original gwent cards.
This does mean that the visualisation sdl code will not work. The `.json` files specify what is missing and where they need to go.

See: https://github.com/exane/not-gwent-online for high resolution images which are used in this visualisation component
